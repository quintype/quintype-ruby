        Hugh Hefner himself. The magazine\u2019s present circulation is 800,000, respectable
        enough for a print magazine when most people just access their content on
        the Internet \u2013 either for free or a small subscription. But, back in
        1972, Playboy did sell 7.2 million copies a month. Now, such numbers can only
        hope to be found on a digital format. Hence the shift in the <i>Playboy</i>\u2019s

        <i>Playboy</i> DNA still resonates and has been retained. The March issue
        has the sex column being written by a woman for the first time. The overall
        vibe is that of a new erotic that is still committed to the Playboy rubric
        of progress, freedom and exploration. It features an interview with <i>MSNBC</i>
        anchor Rachel Maddow, who comments on the presidential elections, going through
        the primaries at present. Maddow apparently agreed to the interview only after
        being told the nudes were gone. </p><p>Other <i>Playboy</i> hallmarks, a piece
        on politics, an essay by the <i>American Psycho</i> author Bret Easton Ellis,
        an excerpt from another book, are all there. </p><p>This <i>Playboy</i> can
        be carried without embarrassment into the workplace or sit on drawing room
        coffee tables. The young target audience will see a new generation of advertisers
        too. The photography has always been a <i>Playboy</i> standard, projected
        not as art, but as a cross between advertising photography and photo-journalism.
        Now, it seeks to be more accessible and natural.</p>"}],"card-updated-at":1455341045232,"content-version-id":"6ea9ea66-0bfe-4524-a6f8-cbe4f8762eee","card-added-at":1455335678266,"status":"draft","id":"06fc36c6-9d2a-405d-991d-353316e11b86","content-id":"06fc36c6-9d2a-405d-991d-353316e11b86","version":14},{"story-elements":[{"description":"","image-metadata":{"width":4800,"height":2700,"mime-type":"image/jpeg"},"page-url":"/story/f451149e-23ac-41c0-9c29-fbe08e4ed1f9/element/bb908b39-18a2-4eb8-8bdf-317412436d73","type":"image","family-id":"c93d07a8-b7f4-44a4-a415-3d0d1482c793","title":"A

        TV chef Sanjeev Kapoor has been asked by the Railway Ministry to get on board
        and design a new menu for the Indian Railways. And not a moment too soon,
        considering the last time I took a train, the food was a ghastly blend of
        cheaply packaged subsidised, culinary afterthoughts. Every once in a while
        garnished with the odd roach, photos of which invariably make their way to
        social media.</p><p>But train journeys have been an intrinsic part of our

        the monkey capped Bengalis en route to Kalimpong from Calcutta and the honeymooners
        canoodling not inconspicuously in the Raymond\u2019s blanket.</p><p>Food was
        the common thread that bound us as we chugged along in those musty compartments.
        It sparked debates between strangers, provided much needed sustenance and
        now fond memories of Nani packing \u2018aloo puri\u2019, \u2018kebab parantha\u2019
        rolls, even slipping in a box of \u2018motichoor ladoos\u2019. Anything that
        basically minimised the chances of spillage. </p><p>I remember now the train
        rolling into Allahabad junction and the thought of \u2018Hari ke samose\u2019
        would make my mouth water. It was always at Mughal Sarai in between engine
        changes, that we bought steaming hot aloo bhaji served on plates made from

        aspirations to grow into new geographies and the exigencies of running a government
        that needs to deliver on its mandate in a given time frame remains. This has
        been most acutely seen in West Bengal, where the BJP, bolstered by its strong
        performance in the 2014 Lok Sabha election, took on the Trinamool Congress
        virtually from day one. </p><p>The result was Trinamool became the driving
        force of a difficult and stubborn Opposition in the Rajya Sabha, stalled key
        legislations and wasted the winter session of Parliament. </p><p>Ironically,
        through all this, the Modi government was completely fair to the Trinamool
        administration in Calcutta. It didn\u2019t discriminate against the Bengal
        and Bihar governments, for instance, in granting greater revenues from coal
        and mineral auctions to resource-rich states. Both states are run by rival
        parties that will take on the BJP in electoral battles in the near future.</p><p>
        A more cold-blooded political culture, and at least some senior people in
        the party, would have preferred a round of hard bargaining. </p><p> What does
        year two hold for Shah and his team? Bihar, where polling is meant to take
        place in October, is a crucial challenge. </p><p>The BJP has relatively less
        at stake in elections in Bengal (due next summer but likely to be brought
        forward, Trinamool sources suggest) and in Tamil Nadu (which votes in early
        2016). It is no wonder then that Amit Shah will be on that flight to Patna
        very often in the coming months. </p><p>(<i>The writer is a political commentator</i>)</p>","description":"","title":"","page-url":"/story/fcbf444f-d649-47d1-bd42-f53e9f3094ef/element/54708793-9aa8-41fc-9384-1049dbf83a5f"}],"card-updated-at":1432233636504,"content-version-id":"f0a2ea91-62b4-4958-88cd-608538da8413","card-added-at":1432227847864,"status":"draft","id":"6a84ccb3-bb05-46b6-bbc6-1ada0ac7b727","content-id":"6a84ccb3-bb05-46b6-bbc6-1ada0ac7b727","version":4}],"story-version-id":"9583a2c5-a921-4bd3-8a35-107a52c36139","content-updated-at":1432238444891,"author-id":748,"owner-id":638,"first-published-at":1432238444887,"hero-image-caption":"File

        remember him upbraiding the organisers at Sivakasi for serving him Nescafe
        instead of the fabled aromatic filter coffee. Such was his disarming simplicity.
        To this day I can\u2019t believe anybody could even slightly harm him, what
        to speak of liquidating him.</p><p>When he arrived a little after 9 in the
        night at Sriperumbudur, he looked rosy fresh and the charm on his visage was
        too attractive for even the dullest and vacant onlooker to ignore. Stealing
        a second glance at him was irresistible. For me it was energy boosting, because
        I was so used to his enviably handsome figure that did not show the slightest
        sign of fatigue even at the end of a punishing 8 AM to 1 AM schedule.</p><h2>The
        Rest is History</h2><p> The mild explosion that I heard a minute or two later
        did not initially set off any alarm in me. My first reaction was that it was
        part of an enthusiastic reception, something that happens every other day
        in the state, especially in the rural areas. I was soon alerted by a shrieking
        crowd that led to me believe that something was amiss.</p><p>I froze. I however
        recovered soon enough to join G K Moopanar and Jayanthi Natarajan on a hunt
        to locate Rajiv. I ran hither and thither around the rostrum, stamping out
        a small flame that was consuming a portion of the red carpet that had been
        laid out for the evening. </p><p>That action on reflex could have been disastrous
        if there had been any remnants of explosive material at the spot. It did not
        take long to realise that Rajiv had been targeted by a hostile element and
        killed. When I tried to lift what remained of Rajiv\u2019s mortal frame, there
        was hardly anything that I could hold on to.</p><p>As I kept a night-long
        vigil all by myself over the numerous bodies lying around me near the rostrum
        \u2013 this was after Rajiv\u2019s had been taken by road to Madras by the
        organisers and state officials \u2013 I had a few minutes to reflect on what
        had happened.</p><p> I just couldn\u2019t believe that someone could exterminate
        a man who bore no ill will to any fellow being. He was sometimes juvenile
        and petulant, but never malicious or scornful.</p><p>I wasn\u2019t affected
        by thoughts of personal safety. Actually my wife and son didn\u2019t know
        until the next morning that I was still alive. Believe it or not, nobody at
        police headquarters gave them the information they were desperate to get.
        Such is the cruelty that I am now willing to forget. But I cannot forgive
        those who snuffed out a valuable life.</p>","description":"","title":"","page-url":"/story/1e177d44-254b-4986-8874-bc65b24e450c/element/369cefd7-82d4-4065-9de2-21d00a947822"},{"type":"image","id":"983da81a-7d41-48b0-823c-53b467130c81","family-id":"3c79495a-5eb9-4af5-8b85-da5b17d5401c","image-s3-key":"thequint/2015-05/05dc188b-1d33-498c-a4cc-6f05e7d04d8e/Rajiv

        no one in their family had ever married outside the caste. She was barred
        from meeting me... they were very clear, it had to end. There were no cellphones
        back then, so once a day we somehow spoke over the landline, mainly in whispers.
        And during one of those whispering sessions, we decided to get married in
        a civil court. Sometime in mid 2000 we secretly got married and went back
        to our own homes, feeling secure that now no one could separate us. And this
