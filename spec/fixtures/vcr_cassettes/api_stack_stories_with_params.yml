        Thursday,  Arunachal Pradesh\u2019s former Chief Minister, Nabam Tuki,  filed
        a fresh petition in the Supreme Court challenging the promulgation of President\u2019s
        rule in the crisis-hit state.\nThe plea filed by the Congress leader is likely
        to be taken up for hearing on Monday by a five-judge constitution bench headed
        by Justice J S Khehar, along with other petitions moved by persons like Rajesh
        Tacho, Chief Whip of the Congress  party in the state assembly.</p><p>The
        plea has been filed after Attorney General Mukul Rohatgi, representing the
        Centre, had raised the objection that earlier petitions have not challenged
        the imposition of President\u2019s rule, which was invoked after filing of
        those pleas.\nYesterday, the imposition of President\u2019s rule in Arunachal
        Pradesh had come under the scanner of the apex court which sought the report
        of Governor Jyoti Prasad Rajkhowa, saying \u201Cit is too serious a matter\u201D.
        </p><p>The bench had asked the Attorney General not to raise \u201Ctechnical
        objections\u201D when he persisted with his plea arguing that \u201Crules
        are rules\u201D and they apply equally to all.\nIt had then posted the matter
        for February 1, 2016, asking the Governor and the Ministry of Home Affairs
        to file responses by Friday, by when the petitioners have been allowed to
        amend their plea. </p><p>The bench, for its own perusal, sought in a sealed
        cover the report and recommendation on imposition of the President\u2019s
        rule.\n\u201CUnless we get the grounds for recommending the President\u2019s
        rule, we cannot proceed. If grounds are not same in the proclamation then
        it is totally a different ball game,\u201D the bench, also comprising justices
        Dipak Misra, M B Lokur, P C Ghose and N V Ramana, had said.</p><p>The five-judge
        bench is examining the constitutional provisions on the scope of discretionary
        powers of Governor, amid continuing month-long impasse over Nabam Tuki-led
        Congress government in Arunachal Pradesh.\nAn earlier plea filed by Nabam
        Rebia, who was allegedly removed from the post of Speaker by rebel Congress
        and BJP MLAs in an assembly session held at a community hall in Itanagar on
        December 16, has listed out legal questions, including the Governor\u2019s
        power to convene the assembly session without the aid and advice of the government
        for adjudication by the apex court. </p>"}],"card-updated-at":1453968372694,"content-version-id":"87564154-4cc2-4a04-8ca1-a77013c0411d","card-added-at":1453965893599,"status":"draft","id":"4d25f9bf-9c9b-4b34-a56a-1877cd84c9c6","content-id":"4d25f9bf-9c9b-4b34-a56a-1877cd84c9c6","version":12}],"story-version-id":"d59cb0eb-b2ac-4539-b724-be2a945044a9","content-updated-at":1453948700927,"author-id":19,"owner-id":2061,"access":null,"first-published-at":1453948700778,"hero-image-caption":"Arunachal

        History of Bodo Politics</h2><p>Way back in 1927, they had submitted a memorandum
        to the Simon Commission through the Kachhari Yuva Sammelan demanding an independent
        identity and the raising of a Kachhari regiment.</p><p>In independent India,
        the central government took the first erroneous step in 1993 when the Bodoland
        Autonomous Council (BAC) was established in the wake of years of violent agitations
        by the All Bodo Students\u2019 Union (ABSU).</p><p>But the BAC was given no
        power over law and order, security or financial matters. As a result, the
        ABSU lost control over the situation and the agitation passed over to a militant
        organisation named the Bodo Liberation Tigers (BLT).</p><p>The arson and mayhem
        continued till 2003 when the central and Assam governments and the BLT signed
        another agreement creating a Bodoland Territorial Autonomous District (BTAD)
        which would be governed by the Bodoland Territorial Council (BTC).</p><p>Out
        of the BLT was born the Bodoland People\u2019s Front which has been ruling
        the BTC for a long time. The attitude of successive central governments towards
        the problems in the northeast has never been different from the one which
        the Narendra Modi-led government has displayed this time over the Bodo problem.</p><p>This
        remained so in regard to the BTC also. The practice of autonomy and self-rule
        on the basis of ethnicity came under serious question when the National Democratic
        Front of Bodoland (Sangbijit) faction massacred innocent Adivasis on two previous
        occasions in spite of the BPF ruling the BTC.</p><p>But the irony remains
        in the fact that neither are the Bodos numerically superior in the BTAD and
        neither is IK Sangbijit, once the leader of the most powerful Bodo outfit,
        an ethnic Bodo. He is a Karbi. It is not clear whether he still runs a faction
        of the NDFB. Yet his writ now runs over large swaths of the BTAD.</p>"}],"card-updated-at":1453886744877,"content-version-id":"2a40707a-372a-4d96-bf20-ace60f154767","card-added-at":1453882538166,"status":"draft","id":"4c31a3a2-aeba-48b6-bd3f-21cca65b23b2","content-id":"4c31a3a2-aeba-48b6-bd3f-21cca65b23b2","version":7},{"story-elements":[{"description":"","image-metadata":{"width":1821,"height":1024,"mime-type":"image/jpeg"},"page-url":"/story/f4d38228-3328-4aae-bba0-2feb50eed9dc/element/882bb3d5-d8a2-41a3-978d-23fc5ed07b40","type":"image","family-id":"61f4ecc0-3065-41e6-9c72-0605277e77d4","title":"Activists

        Shortsightedness</h2><p>Trying to be smart with tribal sentiments in the northeast
        is a dangerous game and the central government must put a stop to the infiltration
        from Bangladesh which is at the root of the Bodo problem.</p><p>The BTAD,
        comprising the districts of Kokrajhar, Udalguri, Baska and Chirang, has only
        around 30 percent of the Bodo population and the rest 70 percent comprises
        Adivasis and other non-tribal communities.</p><p>So, the natural fallout has
        repeated violent attacks by the NDFB, the secessionist group among the Bodos,
        for ethnic cleansing. Since 1993, this has become a common pattern and the
        long rule of the BTC by the Indian mainstream-friendly BPF has been unable
        to prevent this.</p><p>As the BPF\u2019s hold on the Bodo people has become
        tenuous and as the hardliners enjoy more credibility, the BJP\u2019s alliance
        with the BPF may earn it a few more assembly seats but may not help iron out
        the Bodo alienation.</p><p>Never before have men in New Delhi shown maturity
        in dealing with the Bodo problem. For more than a decade, the BPF enjoyed
        a cozy relationship with the Assam Congress and its sudden volte face in favour
        of the BJP is likely to further erode its credibility.</p><p>Secondly, the
        Bodo militancy has expanded from its traditional bases in Kokrajhar and Udalguri
        and now encompasses the militarily strategic districts of Darrang and Sonitpur.</p><p>There
        is no proof in the public domain that the central government is worried about
        this. Thirdly, by unwisely conceding the frequent use of the term Bodoland
        in several agreements and administrative arrangements, the centre has stoked
        a fire of hope among the Bodo leaders that the idea of Bodoland, independent
        or a state within India, is on its way to fruition.</p><p>As a result of the
        last-mentioned factor, ethnic cleansing of Muslims and Adivasis is under way
        in Bodo strongholds. There are indications that the migration of Muslims is
        taking place in areas like Kokrajhar and Udalguri.</p><p>But the Santhals,
        the largest tea tribe of Assam, have geared themselves up to hit back. To
        this end, they have organized military wings like the Birsa Commando Force
        and the Sammilita Janagoshthiya Sangram Samity.</p><p>Has the Narendra Modi-led

        Mix and match is the best way to create a password. Your keyboard has numbers
        and special characters. Use them to your advantage. Also try using upper and
        lower case characters in your password.</p><p>The best passwords with all
        the above criteria, might not even be in English but in your native language.
        </p><p>Some Examples:<br><b>a. \u2018tamatarjuice\u2019</b> (Tomato Juice

        </b>can be typed like <b>\u2018Pa$$w0rd\u2019</b></p><p><b>5. </b>A single
        word password is also not a good idea. Try building sentences. Single word
        passwords are easy to crack, while sentences take a lot of time to crack.
        And a sentence with special characters is a double whammy.</p><p>It\u2019s
        absolutely fine to have space between letters. That makes it a little harder
        for a hacker\u2019s software to guess the password. </p><p>Some Examples:<br><b>a.</b>
        <b>\u2018i love bhelpuri\u2019</b> can be typed as <b>\u2018! L0v3 Bh31pur!\u2019<br>b.

        aspirations to grow into new geographies and the exigencies of running a government
        that needs to deliver on its mandate in a given time frame remains. This has
        been most acutely seen in West Bengal, where the BJP, bolstered by its strong
        performance in the 2014 Lok Sabha election, took on the Trinamool Congress
        virtually from day one. </p><p>The result was Trinamool became the driving
        force of a difficult and stubborn Opposition in the Rajya Sabha, stalled key
        legislations and wasted the winter session of Parliament. </p><p>Ironically,
        through all this, the Modi government was completely fair to the Trinamool
        administration in Calcutta. It didn\u2019t discriminate against the Bengal
        and Bihar governments, for instance, in granting greater revenues from coal
        and mineral auctions to resource-rich states. Both states are run by rival
        parties that will take on the BJP in electoral battles in the near future.</p><p>
        A more cold-blooded political culture, and at least some senior people in
        the party, would have preferred a round of hard bargaining. </p><p> What does
        year two hold for Shah and his team? Bihar, where polling is meant to take
        place in October, is a crucial challenge. </p><p>The BJP has relatively less
        at stake in elections in Bengal (due next summer but likely to be brought
        forward, Trinamool sources suggest) and in Tamil Nadu (which votes in early
        2016). It is no wonder then that Amit Shah will be on that flight to Patna

        remember him upbraiding the organisers at Sivakasi for serving him Nescafe
        instead of the fabled aromatic filter coffee. Such was his disarming simplicity.
        To this day I can\u2019t believe anybody could even slightly harm him, what
        to speak of liquidating him.</p><p>When he arrived a little after 9 in the
        night at Sriperumbudur, he looked rosy fresh and the charm on his visage was
        too attractive for even the dullest and vacant onlooker to ignore. Stealing
        a second glance at him was irresistible. For me it was energy boosting, because
        I was so used to his enviably handsome figure that did not show the slightest
        sign of fatigue even at the end of a punishing 8 AM to 1 AM schedule.</p><h2>The
        Rest is History</h2><p> The mild explosion that I heard a minute or two later
        did not initially set off any alarm in me. My first reaction was that it was
        part of an enthusiastic reception, something that happens every other day
        in the state, especially in the rural areas. I was soon alerted by a shrieking
        crowd that led to me believe that something was amiss.</p><p>I froze. I however
        recovered soon enough to join G K Moopanar and Jayanthi Natarajan on a hunt
        to locate Rajiv. I ran hither and thither around the rostrum, stamping out
        a small flame that was consuming a portion of the red carpet that had been
        laid out for the evening. </p><p>That action on reflex could have been disastrous
        if there had been any remnants of explosive material at the spot. It did not
        take long to realise that Rajiv had been targeted by a hostile element and
        killed. When I tried to lift what remained of Rajiv\u2019s mortal frame, there
        was hardly anything that I could hold on to.</p><p>As I kept a night-long
        vigil all by myself over the numerous bodies lying around me near the rostrum
        \u2013 this was after Rajiv\u2019s had been taken by road to Madras by the
        organisers and state officials \u2013 I had a few minutes to reflect on what
        had happened.</p><p> I just couldn\u2019t believe that someone could exterminate
        a man who bore no ill will to any fellow being. He was sometimes juvenile
        and petulant, but never malicious or scornful.</p><p>I wasn\u2019t affected
        by thoughts of personal safety. Actually my wife and son didn\u2019t know
        until the next morning that I was still alive. Believe it or not, nobody at
        police headquarters gave them the information they were desperate to get.
        Such is the cruelty that I am now willing to forget. But I cannot forgive
        those who snuffed out a valuable life.</p>","description":"","title":"","page-url":"/story/1e177d44-254b-4986-8874-bc65b24e450c/element/369cefd7-82d4-4065-9de2-21d00a947822"},{"type":"image","id":"983da81a-7d41-48b0-823c-53b467130c81","family-id":"3c79495a-5eb9-4af5-8b85-da5b17d5401c","image-s3-key":"thequint/2015-05/05dc188b-1d33-498c-a4cc-6f05e7d04d8e/Rajiv
