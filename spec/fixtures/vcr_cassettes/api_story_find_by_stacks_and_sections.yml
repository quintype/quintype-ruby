        the gravest concern, have reduced drastically, especially after the November
        2003 ceasefire. The author of the article in <i>The Hindu</i> goes on to opine
        that just because we have militarily and materially invested in the Siachen
        region over the years, it does not provide us with a strategically sound rationale
        to continue stationing troops there \u2013 only to keep losing them year after
        year.</p><p>So what is the strategic significance of Siachen? Lt Gen ML Chibber,
        the erstwhile Northern Army Commander had succinctly stated that the Siachen
        glacier is a wedge that keeps the two adversaries apart. If one were to concede
        to the Pakistani view that the line north of NJ 9842 does indeed join with
        the Karakoram Pass, it would literally amount to the Chinese presence in the
        Shaksgam valley moving southwards to the Nubra valley.</p><p>With reported
        activity of Chinese troops involved in building projects in Gilgit and Baltistan,
        the general area, right down to the Shyok valley will become a collusive playground
        and a zone for future exploitation by the Chinese and Pakistanis through the
        Khunjerab and Karakoram passes. Occupation of the Saltoro and Siachen provides
        a buffer to Ladakh and in military parlance, the much needed depth to important
        mountain passes that are gateways to Ladakh and Kashmir.</p><p>There are some
        who point out that it is futile to hold on to the positions on the Saltoro
        ridgeline because they are important only tactically and are of no strategic
        significance. They are obviously unaware of the prevailing conditions in Siachen
        and the unequal advantage that accrues to a defender deployed in prepared
        positions on heights of 18,000 feet. </p><p>Whereas no position is ever considered
        impregnable by a determined body of soldiers \u2013 ask any survivor of such
        an attack that either failed or succeeded, about his tribulations and his
        brush with death at close quarters. The professionals in the Pakistan Army
        are not na\u00EFve to have attempted to capture pickets on the Saltoro over
        and over again despite heavy casualties. If ever there was a tactical gain
        that was instrumental in providing exponential dividend to a strategic cause,
        this is one.</p>","id":"d6325ee9-50e4-499b-afbf-86b0fbcfa4ee","family-id":"e9af9824-4758-4f8e-b3d6-e026b46438ed","type":"text","page-url":"/story/f8e528ab-13a6-4d9a-b271-37d654e7d3a1/element/d6325ee9-50e4-499b-afbf-86b0fbcfa4ee"}],"card-updated-at":1455311754923,"content-version-id":"041cf09a-1af6-4dd8-b23e-33695d373b49","card-added-at":1455306295457,"status":"draft","id":"75786359-d78b-4a28-81aa-3876d0c9f227","content-id":"75786359-d78b-4a28-81aa-3876d0c9f227","version":4},{"story-elements":[{"description":"","title":"","subtype":null,"metadata":{},"text":"<h2>Prospects

        and analysts alike agree with the view that the two nations and their armies
        are engaged in a futile conflict in some of the most inhospitable terrain.
        The benefits of de-militarisation are not lost on any rational thinking person.
        </p><p>The area can be transformed into a peace park or a laboratory for scientific
        experiments \u2013 the environment can be protected and mountaineering expeditions
        can be flagged off. Moreover, casualties can be avoided and the national exchequers
        of both countries can be eased a trifle.</p><p>There is, however, a caveat.
        What if the agreement is flouted and the positions are occupied by the Pakistan
        Army? There are proponents who advocate that there should be adequate safeguards
        built into the agreement to include punitive action, if the aggrieved nation
        so desires. In practice, punitive action is easier said than done, more importantly
        generating the political will to authorise it. </p><p>If one was to put one\u2019s
        finger on just one factor that had an overarching impact on the resolution
        of the Siachen problem, it would be mutual trust or rather, the lack of it.
        The level of mistrust between India and Pakistan in general and the Indian
        and Pakistani security forces in particular is so deep-rooted that it will
        take the better part of a couple of generations to overturn. </p><p>Starting
        with the proxy war in 1989, the illegal occupation of Kargil heights in 1999,
        and the alleged role of the ISI in a number of terrorist actions in India
        would make an exhaustive list. The attack on the Parliament and the Mumbai
        terrorist attack on 26/11 are bitter reminders. Calibrating the proxy war
        in Jammu &amp; Kashmir, providing financial and moral support to <i>tanzeems</i>
        and unwillingness to expel terrorism from their soil are at the base of Pakistan\u2019s
        rampant mistrust. It must be remembered that nations grow, prosper and develop
        when the sanctity of their borders is intact.</p><p>As acknowledged by the
        defence minister, members of the Indian defence forces deployed in the Siachen
        glacier region are performing a challenging role in extremely harsh and adverse
        conditions and the nation must laud their efforts. I close with the following
        lines that express a soldier\u2019s wish:</p><p><i>He seeks no reward, material
        or otherwise; <br>His karm\u200Ba he performs with honour and pride; <br>Yet

        the gravest concern, have reduced drastically, especially after the November
        2003 ceasefire. The author of the article in <i>The Hindu</i> goes on to opine
        that just because we have militarily and materially invested in the Siachen
        region over the years, it does not provide us with a strategically sound rationale
        to continue stationing troops there \u2013 only to keep losing them year after
        year.</p><p>So what is the strategic significance of Siachen? Lt Gen ML Chibber,
        the erstwhile Northern Army Commander had succinctly stated that the Siachen
        glacier is a wedge that keeps the two adversaries apart. If one were to concede
        to the Pakistani view that the line north of NJ 9842 does indeed join with
        the Karakoram Pass, it would literally amount to the Chinese presence in the
        Shaksgam valley moving southwards to the Nubra valley.</p><p>With reported
        activity of Chinese troops involved in building projects in Gilgit and Baltistan,
        the general area, right down to the Shyok valley will become a collusive playground
        and a zone for future exploitation by the Chinese and Pakistanis through the
        Khunjerab and Karakoram passes. Occupation of the Saltoro and Siachen provides
        a buffer to Ladakh and in military parlance, the much needed depth to important
        mountain passes that are gateways to Ladakh and Kashmir.</p><p>There are some
        who point out that it is futile to hold on to the positions on the Saltoro
        ridgeline because they are important only tactically and are of no strategic
        significance. They are obviously unaware of the prevailing conditions in Siachen
        and the unequal advantage that accrues to a defender deployed in prepared
        positions on heights of 18,000 feet. </p><p>Whereas no position is ever considered
        impregnable by a determined body of soldiers \u2013 ask any survivor of such
        an attack that either failed or succeeded, about his tribulations and his
        brush with death at close quarters. The professionals in the Pakistan Army
        are not na\u00EFve to have attempted to capture pickets on the Saltoro over
        and over again despite heavy casualties. If ever there was a tactical gain
        that was instrumental in providing exponential dividend to a strategic cause,
        this is one.</p>","id":"d6325ee9-50e4-499b-afbf-86b0fbcfa4ee","family-id":"e9af9824-4758-4f8e-b3d6-e026b46438ed","type":"text","page-url":"/story/f8e528ab-13a6-4d9a-b271-37d654e7d3a1/element/d6325ee9-50e4-499b-afbf-86b0fbcfa4ee"}],"card-updated-at":1455311754923,"content-version-id":"041cf09a-1af6-4dd8-b23e-33695d373b49","card-added-at":1455306295457,"status":"draft","id":"75786359-d78b-4a28-81aa-3876d0c9f227","content-id":"75786359-d78b-4a28-81aa-3876d0c9f227","version":4},{"story-elements":[{"description":"","title":"","subtype":null,"metadata":{},"text":"<h2>Prospects

        and analysts alike agree with the view that the two nations and their armies
        are engaged in a futile conflict in some of the most inhospitable terrain.
        The benefits of de-militarisation are not lost on any rational thinking person.
        </p><p>The area can be transformed into a peace park or a laboratory for scientific
        experiments \u2013 the environment can be protected and mountaineering expeditions
        can be flagged off. Moreover, casualties can be avoided and the national exchequers
        of both countries can be eased a trifle.</p><p>There is, however, a caveat.
        What if the agreement is flouted and the positions are occupied by the Pakistan
        Army? There are proponents who advocate that there should be adequate safeguards
        built into the agreement to include punitive action, if the aggrieved nation
        so desires. In practice, punitive action is easier said than done, more importantly
        generating the political will to authorise it. </p><p>If one was to put one\u2019s
        finger on just one factor that had an overarching impact on the resolution
        of the Siachen problem, it would be mutual trust or rather, the lack of it.
        The level of mistrust between India and Pakistan in general and the Indian
        and Pakistani security forces in particular is so deep-rooted that it will
        take the better part of a couple of generations to overturn. </p><p>Starting
        with the proxy war in 1989, the illegal occupation of Kargil heights in 1999,
        and the alleged role of the ISI in a number of terrorist actions in India
        would make an exhaustive list. The attack on the Parliament and the Mumbai
        terrorist attack on 26/11 are bitter reminders. Calibrating the proxy war
        in Jammu &amp; Kashmir, providing financial and moral support to <i>tanzeems</i>
        and unwillingness to expel terrorism from their soil are at the base of Pakistan\u2019s
        rampant mistrust. It must be remembered that nations grow, prosper and develop
        when the sanctity of their borders is intact.</p><p>As acknowledged by the
        defence minister, members of the Indian defence forces deployed in the Siachen
        glacier region are performing a challenging role in extremely harsh and adverse
        conditions and the nation must laud their efforts. I close with the following
        lines that express a soldier\u2019s wish:</p><p><i>He seeks no reward, material
        or otherwise; <br>His karm\u200Ba he performs with honour and pride; <br>Yet

        the gravest concern, have reduced drastically, especially after the November
        2003 ceasefire. The author of the article in <i>The Hindu</i> goes on to opine
        that just because we have militarily and materially invested in the Siachen
        region over the years, it does not provide us with a strategically sound rationale
        to continue stationing troops there \u2013 only to keep losing them year after
        year.</p><p>So what is the strategic significance of Siachen? Lt Gen ML Chibber,
        the erstwhile Northern Army Commander had succinctly stated that the Siachen
        glacier is a wedge that keeps the two adversaries apart. If one were to concede
        to the Pakistani view that the line north of NJ 9842 does indeed join with
        the Karakoram Pass, it would literally amount to the Chinese presence in the
        Shaksgam valley moving southwards to the Nubra valley.</p><p>With reported
        activity of Chinese troops involved in building projects in Gilgit and Baltistan,
        the general area, right down to the Shyok valley will become a collusive playground
        and a zone for future exploitation by the Chinese and Pakistanis through the
        Khunjerab and Karakoram passes. Occupation of the Saltoro and Siachen provides
        a buffer to Ladakh and in military parlance, the much needed depth to important
        mountain passes that are gateways to Ladakh and Kashmir.</p><p>There are some
        who point out that it is futile to hold on to the positions on the Saltoro
        ridgeline because they are important only tactically and are of no strategic
        significance. They are obviously unaware of the prevailing conditions in Siachen
        and the unequal advantage that accrues to a defender deployed in prepared
        positions on heights of 18,000 feet. </p><p>Whereas no position is ever considered
        impregnable by a determined body of soldiers \u2013 ask any survivor of such
        an attack that either failed or succeeded, about his tribulations and his
        brush with death at close quarters. The professionals in the Pakistan Army
        are not na\u00EFve to have attempted to capture pickets on the Saltoro over
        and over again despite heavy casualties. If ever there was a tactical gain
        that was instrumental in providing exponential dividend to a strategic cause,
        this is one.</p>","id":"d6325ee9-50e4-499b-afbf-86b0fbcfa4ee","family-id":"e9af9824-4758-4f8e-b3d6-e026b46438ed","type":"text","page-url":"/story/f8e528ab-13a6-4d9a-b271-37d654e7d3a1/element/d6325ee9-50e4-499b-afbf-86b0fbcfa4ee"}],"card-updated-at":1455311754923,"content-version-id":"041cf09a-1af6-4dd8-b23e-33695d373b49","card-added-at":1455306295457,"status":"draft","id":"75786359-d78b-4a28-81aa-3876d0c9f227","content-id":"75786359-d78b-4a28-81aa-3876d0c9f227","version":4},{"story-elements":[{"description":"","title":"","subtype":null,"metadata":{},"text":"<h2>Prospects

        and analysts alike agree with the view that the two nations and their armies
        are engaged in a futile conflict in some of the most inhospitable terrain.
        The benefits of de-militarisation are not lost on any rational thinking person.
        </p><p>The area can be transformed into a peace park or a laboratory for scientific
        experiments \u2013 the environment can be protected and mountaineering expeditions
        can be flagged off. Moreover, casualties can be avoided and the national exchequers
        of both countries can be eased a trifle.</p><p>There is, however, a caveat.
        What if the agreement is flouted and the positions are occupied by the Pakistan
        Army? There are proponents who advocate that there should be adequate safeguards
        built into the agreement to include punitive action, if the aggrieved nation
        so desires. In practice, punitive action is easier said than done, more importantly
        generating the political will to authorise it. </p><p>If one was to put one\u2019s
        finger on just one factor that had an overarching impact on the resolution
        of the Siachen problem, it would be mutual trust or rather, the lack of it.
        The level of mistrust between India and Pakistan in general and the Indian
        and Pakistani security forces in particular is so deep-rooted that it will
        take the better part of a couple of generations to overturn. </p><p>Starting
        with the proxy war in 1989, the illegal occupation of Kargil heights in 1999,
        and the alleged role of the ISI in a number of terrorist actions in India
        would make an exhaustive list. The attack on the Parliament and the Mumbai
        terrorist attack on 26/11 are bitter reminders. Calibrating the proxy war
        in Jammu &amp; Kashmir, providing financial and moral support to <i>tanzeems</i>
        and unwillingness to expel terrorism from their soil are at the base of Pakistan\u2019s
        rampant mistrust. It must be remembered that nations grow, prosper and develop
        when the sanctity of their borders is intact.</p><p>As acknowledged by the
        defence minister, members of the Indian defence forces deployed in the Siachen
        glacier region are performing a challenging role in extremely harsh and adverse
        conditions and the nation must laud their efforts. I close with the following
        lines that express a soldier\u2019s wish:</p><p><i>He seeks no reward, material
        or otherwise; <br>His karm\u200Ba he performs with honour and pride; <br>Yet

        the gravest concern, have reduced drastically, especially after the November
        2003 ceasefire. The author of the article in <i>The Hindu</i> goes on to opine
        that just because we have militarily and materially invested in the Siachen
        region over the years, it does not provide us with a strategically sound rationale
        to continue stationing troops there \u2013 only to keep losing them year after
        year.</p><p>So what is the strategic significance of Siachen? Lt Gen ML Chibber,
        the erstwhile Northern Army Commander had succinctly stated that the Siachen
        glacier is a wedge that keeps the two adversaries apart. If one were to concede
        to the Pakistani view that the line north of NJ 9842 does indeed join with
        the Karakoram Pass, it would literally amount to the Chinese presence in the
        Shaksgam valley moving southwards to the Nubra valley.</p><p>With reported
        activity of Chinese troops involved in building projects in Gilgit and Baltistan,
        the general area, right down to the Shyok valley will become a collusive playground
        and a zone for future exploitation by the Chinese and Pakistanis through the
        Khunjerab and Karakoram passes. Occupation of the Saltoro and Siachen provides
        a buffer to Ladakh and in military parlance, the much needed depth to important
        mountain passes that are gateways to Ladakh and Kashmir.</p><p>There are some
        who point out that it is futile to hold on to the positions on the Saltoro
        ridgeline because they are important only tactically and are of no strategic
        significance. They are obviously unaware of the prevailing conditions in Siachen
        and the unequal advantage that accrues to a defender deployed in prepared
        positions on heights of 18,000 feet. </p><p>Whereas no position is ever considered
        impregnable by a determined body of soldiers \u2013 ask any survivor of such
        an attack that either failed or succeeded, about his tribulations and his
        brush with death at close quarters. The professionals in the Pakistan Army
        are not na\u00EFve to have attempted to capture pickets on the Saltoro over
        and over again despite heavy casualties. If ever there was a tactical gain
        that was instrumental in providing exponential dividend to a strategic cause,
        this is one.</p>","id":"d6325ee9-50e4-499b-afbf-86b0fbcfa4ee","family-id":"e9af9824-4758-4f8e-b3d6-e026b46438ed","type":"text","page-url":"/story/f8e528ab-13a6-4d9a-b271-37d654e7d3a1/element/d6325ee9-50e4-499b-afbf-86b0fbcfa4ee"}],"card-updated-at":1455311754923,"content-version-id":"041cf09a-1af6-4dd8-b23e-33695d373b49","card-added-at":1455306295457,"status":"draft","id":"75786359-d78b-4a28-81aa-3876d0c9f227","content-id":"75786359-d78b-4a28-81aa-3876d0c9f227","version":4},{"story-elements":[{"description":"","title":"","subtype":null,"metadata":{},"text":"<h2>Prospects

        and analysts alike agree with the view that the two nations and their armies
        are engaged in a futile conflict in some of the most inhospitable terrain.
        The benefits of de-militarisation are not lost on any rational thinking person.
        </p><p>The area can be transformed into a peace park or a laboratory for scientific
        experiments \u2013 the environment can be protected and mountaineering expeditions
        can be flagged off. Moreover, casualties can be avoided and the national exchequers
        of both countries can be eased a trifle.</p><p>There is, however, a caveat.
        What if the agreement is flouted and the positions are occupied by the Pakistan
        Army? There are proponents who advocate that there should be adequate safeguards
        built into the agreement to include punitive action, if the aggrieved nation
        so desires. In practice, punitive action is easier said than done, more importantly
        generating the political will to authorise it. </p><p>If one was to put one\u2019s
        finger on just one factor that had an overarching impact on the resolution
        of the Siachen problem, it would be mutual trust or rather, the lack of it.
        The level of mistrust between India and Pakistan in general and the Indian
        and Pakistani security forces in particular is so deep-rooted that it will
        take the better part of a couple of generations to overturn. </p><p>Starting
        with the proxy war in 1989, the illegal occupation of Kargil heights in 1999,
        and the alleged role of the ISI in a number of terrorist actions in India
        would make an exhaustive list. The attack on the Parliament and the Mumbai
        terrorist attack on 26/11 are bitter reminders. Calibrating the proxy war
        in Jammu &amp; Kashmir, providing financial and moral support to <i>tanzeems</i>
        and unwillingness to expel terrorism from their soil are at the base of Pakistan\u2019s
        rampant mistrust. It must be remembered that nations grow, prosper and develop
        when the sanctity of their borders is intact.</p><p>As acknowledged by the
        defence minister, members of the Indian defence forces deployed in the Siachen
        glacier region are performing a challenging role in extremely harsh and adverse
        conditions and the nation must laud their efforts. I close with the following
        lines that express a soldier\u2019s wish:</p><p><i>He seeks no reward, material
        or otherwise; <br>His karm\u200Ba he performs with honour and pride; <br>Yet

        the gravest concern, have reduced drastically, especially after the November
        2003 ceasefire. The author of the article in <i>The Hindu</i> goes on to opine
        that just because we have militarily and materially invested in the Siachen
        region over the years, it does not provide us with a strategically sound rationale
        to continue stationing troops there \u2013 only to keep losing them year after
        year.</p><p>So what is the strategic significance of Siachen? Lt Gen ML Chibber,
        the erstwhile Northern Army Commander had succinctly stated that the Siachen
        glacier is a wedge that keeps the two adversaries apart. If one were to concede
        to the Pakistani view that the line north of NJ 9842 does indeed join with
        the Karakoram Pass, it would literally amount to the Chinese presence in the
        Shaksgam valley moving southwards to the Nubra valley.</p><p>With reported
        activity of Chinese troops involved in building projects in Gilgit and Baltistan,
        the general area, right down to the Shyok valley will become a collusive playground
        and a zone for future exploitation by the Chinese and Pakistanis through the
        Khunjerab and Karakoram passes. Occupation of the Saltoro and Siachen provides
        a buffer to Ladakh and in military parlance, the much needed depth to important
        mountain passes that are gateways to Ladakh and Kashmir.</p><p>There are some
        who point out that it is futile to hold on to the positions on the Saltoro
        ridgeline because they are important only tactically and are of no strategic
        significance. They are obviously unaware of the prevailing conditions in Siachen
        and the unequal advantage that accrues to a defender deployed in prepared
        positions on heights of 18,000 feet. </p><p>Whereas no position is ever considered
        impregnable by a determined body of soldiers \u2013 ask any survivor of such
        an attack that either failed or succeeded, about his tribulations and his
        brush with death at close quarters. The professionals in the Pakistan Army
        are not na\u00EFve to have attempted to capture pickets on the Saltoro over
        and over again despite heavy casualties. If ever there was a tactical gain
        that was instrumental in providing exponential dividend to a strategic cause,
        this is one.</p>","id":"d6325ee9-50e4-499b-afbf-86b0fbcfa4ee","family-id":"e9af9824-4758-4f8e-b3d6-e026b46438ed","type":"text","page-url":"/story/f8e528ab-13a6-4d9a-b271-37d654e7d3a1/element/d6325ee9-50e4-499b-afbf-86b0fbcfa4ee"}],"card-updated-at":1455311754923,"content-version-id":"041cf09a-1af6-4dd8-b23e-33695d373b49","card-added-at":1455306295457,"status":"draft","id":"75786359-d78b-4a28-81aa-3876d0c9f227","content-id":"75786359-d78b-4a28-81aa-3876d0c9f227","version":4},{"story-elements":[{"description":"","title":"","subtype":null,"metadata":{},"text":"<h2>Prospects

        and analysts alike agree with the view that the two nations and their armies
        are engaged in a futile conflict in some of the most inhospitable terrain.
        The benefits of de-militarisation are not lost on any rational thinking person.
        </p><p>The area can be transformed into a peace park or a laboratory for scientific
        experiments \u2013 the environment can be protected and mountaineering expeditions
        can be flagged off. Moreover, casualties can be avoided and the national exchequers
        of both countries can be eased a trifle.</p><p>There is, however, a caveat.
        What if the agreement is flouted and the positions are occupied by the Pakistan
        Army? There are proponents who advocate that there should be adequate safeguards
        built into the agreement to include punitive action, if the aggrieved nation
        so desires. In practice, punitive action is easier said than done, more importantly
        generating the political will to authorise it. </p><p>If one was to put one\u2019s
        finger on just one factor that had an overarching impact on the resolution
        of the Siachen problem, it would be mutual trust or rather, the lack of it.
        The level of mistrust between India and Pakistan in general and the Indian
        and Pakistani security forces in particular is so deep-rooted that it will
        take the better part of a couple of generations to overturn. </p><p>Starting
        with the proxy war in 1989, the illegal occupation of Kargil heights in 1999,
        and the alleged role of the ISI in a number of terrorist actions in India
        would make an exhaustive list. The attack on the Parliament and the Mumbai
        terrorist attack on 26/11 are bitter reminders. Calibrating the proxy war
        in Jammu &amp; Kashmir, providing financial and moral support to <i>tanzeems</i>
        and unwillingness to expel terrorism from their soil are at the base of Pakistan\u2019s
        rampant mistrust. It must be remembered that nations grow, prosper and develop
        when the sanctity of their borders is intact.</p><p>As acknowledged by the
        defence minister, members of the Indian defence forces deployed in the Siachen
        glacier region are performing a challenging role in extremely harsh and adverse
        conditions and the nation must laud their efforts. I close with the following
        lines that express a soldier\u2019s wish:</p><p><i>He seeks no reward, material
        or otherwise; <br>His karm\u200Ba he performs with honour and pride; <br>Yet
