        deserve it. It also makes it easier to take necessary measures to correct
        their behaviour and hold them accountable for their actions, so that they
        can be punished as per the law of the land.</p><p>Valentine\u2019s Day is
        not a bad thing. Celebrate it if you want to. If you think it is too commercial,
        hey, no one is pointing a gun to your head and asking you to splurge on roses
        and diamonds and cards. If your partner expects a gift, make them something
        special. Just don\u2019t make a half hearted attempt. Yes, I know it\u2019s
        the thought that counts, but people can tell when you never intended to succeed.
        Try something simple like order their favourite pizza and rent a DVD of their
        favourite movie and watch it together. Or take them on a long drive or just
        a walk in the park. Don\u2019t feel ashamed of your feelings. Love is beautiful.
        Sex is delightful! (If it isn\u2019t seek counselling)</p><p><i>(Harish Iyer

        are some hilarious one-liners strewn all over the narrative. <i>\u201CMaine
        susu kiya toh mujhe bhi pregnant bataya tha,\u201D </i>reasons Mikesh while
        trying to convince his girlfriend that she\u2019s not pregnant and that the
        pee-stick that showed her positive was just a cheap brand. While a few scenes
        look unconvincing (like the boy in the hospital peeing on the broken wedding
        snow globe), overall the writing wins you over because Biswapati Sarkar keeps
        it smart and simple.</p>"},{"description":"","page-url":"/story/3e76ef9f-c91d-4d14-b396-aa8e88daa3f9/element/d067a666-ae4c-4ad2-abe3-11ca010bc52b","type":"text","family-id":"cacaba47-9531-4e40-9873-277c94a4fdc4","title":"","id":"d067a666-ae4c-4ad2-abe3-11ca010bc52b","metadata":{"content":"The

        February is not just Valentine\u2019s Day. It\u2019s also a historic day in
        Arvind Kejriwal\u2019s calendar. Historic, because  it\u2019s the day the
        Kejriwal-led government completes a year in office. Yes, 365 days as compared
        to its previous  49-day stint. But this comes  at a time when the national
        capital has nothing to do but breathe in pollution and garbage stench.</p><p>A
        lot happened during the past year, and the best way to describe this aam aadami\u2019s

        possible contender to replace Justice Antonin Scalia on the US Supreme Court
        is an Indian-American appeals court judge, Sri Srinivasan, who has pro-business
        credentials and a stellar resume. If he was nominated his background may make
        it more politically challenging for Republicans as they plan to block anyone
        put forward by President Barack Obama.<br></p><p>Srinivasan, 48, has served
        on the US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit since he was
        confirmed on a 97-0 bipartisan vote in the US Senate in May 2013. Republican
        senators who supported him then would likely be asked to justify why they
        couldn\u2019t back him for the Supreme Court.</p><p>Many names are likely
        under consideration and the White House has not tipped its hand, but recent
        Supreme Court appointments have tended to be appeals court judges and the
        appeals court in Washington on which Srinivasan serves has often been a springboard
        to the high court. Scalia himself served on the court, as did other Supreme
        Court members Chief Justice John Roberts, Justice Clarence Thomas and Justice
        Ruth Bader Ginsburg.</p><p>The White House said on Sunday that Obama will
        wait until the US Senate is back in session before making a nomination. The
        Senate returns from recess on 22 February.</p><p>Republicans have called for
        Scalia\u2019s seat to remain open so that the next president, who would take
        office in January 2017, can nominate a replacement. Other judges Obama could
        consider appointing include Paul Watford, a black man who serves on the 9th
        US Circuit Court of Appeals, and Jacqueline Nguyen, a Vietnamese-American
        woman who serves on the same court as Watford.</p><p>Little is known about
        Srinivasan\u2019s views on divisive social issues like abortion and affirmative
        action. But as a senior Justice Department lawyer in 2013, he was part of
        the legal team that successfully urged the high court to strike down the Defense
        of Marriage Act, a law that restricted the definition of marriage to heterosexual
        couples for the purposes of federal benefits. The ruling helped pave the way
        for the court\u2019s ruling in June 2015 that legalized gay marriage nationwide.</p><p>Srinivasan
        could not be reached for comment.</p>"},{"description":"","page-url":"/story/8d39f9d3-cd12-4f2f-b77b-b31f4cbd0831/element/080099bf-b1ce-4fb5-a397-c7ace302afd8","type":"text","family-id":"a04abd54-7651-4d09-965c-af5c1a51efb2","title":"","id":"080099bf-b1ce-4fb5-a397-c7ace302afd8","metadata":{"content":"Srinivasan
