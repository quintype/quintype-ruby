        17 years ago, or to be more precise in February 1999, the NDA government headed
        by Atal Bihari Vajpayee dismissed the 18-month-old Rabri Devi government on
        charges of failing to maintain law and order in Bihar. The immediate provocation
        for putting the state under President\u2019s rule was the killing of 12 dalits,

        Vajpayee, who was then attending the G-15 summit in Jamaica) decided to impose
        President\u2019 rule in Bihar. President KR Narayanan, a stickler for rules,
        who was then out of Delhi and attending a function in West Bengal, sought
        to know why a duly-elected government was dismissed with such urgency and
        the state put under Central rule. It was then that the Governor of Bihar Sunder
        Singh Bhandari, a known RSS leader, recommended that in the aftermath of the

        it had miserably failed to maintain law and order in the state.</p>"},{"description":"","page-url":"/story/013c46ab-3831-47d9-a6ff-b73b24d239ee/element/a6af6fe5-7ec9-48ce-8a5c-5b40903fa926","type":"text","family-id":"164186a2-dc86-4557-8626-f4f9c94f8e42","title":"","id":"a6af6fe5-7ec9-48ce-8a5c-5b40903fa926","metadata":{},"subtype":"summary","text":"<h3>Why

        the perception about him remained a composer of zany scores. Maybe because
        he trapeezed into Bombay music world, after a few false starts, with Guru
        Dutt\u2019s <i>Aar Paar</i> (1954), where the songs were mostly lively, and
        to certain extent, inspired by the west. In the process, he formed critical
        alliances which grew deeper with successes like <i>Mr &amp; Mrs. 55</i> (1955)
        and <i>CID</i> (1956).&nbsp; OP Nayyar grew in stature and in value till he
        was quickly commanding a price of Rs. 1 lakh per film.</p><p>But\u2026 Nayyar
        was a serial killer of all the geese that were laying golden eggs for him.
        Asha Bhosle, for one, with whom he broke up professionally and personally
        in 1972. Geeta Dutt, whom he neglected and sidelined for no apparent reason.
        Ditto with Shamshad Begum. Nayyar did not even spare the men. He was a tad
        bit too harsh on Mohd. Rafi, leading to a musical separation of over two years.
        Quarrels are commonplace in Bollywood. But the shared goals between the parties
        involved ensures speedy resolution. Nayyar made no such patch-up attempt with
        Rafi, the then #1 male playback singer. Worse, he tried to replace Rafi with
        Mahendra Kapoor making it obvious that he was settling for not the best options
        available, thus devaluing himself. Nayyar publicly rubbished Kishore\u2019s
        rendition of <i>Savere ka Suraj </i>from <i>Ek Baar Muskura Do</i> (1972),
        a song he composed, directed and supervised the recording of. He forgot that
        pointing a finger at someone meant three other fingers pointed back at him.

        time and place in history that denied the right of different groups of people
        to speak in their own names. In the West, it followed a logic of accommodation
        between privileged and formerly enslaved or colonised races. In India, it

        about his identity, politics, and symbolism for India\u2019s future. Regardless
        of our own stakes in them, we must remember one thing. There are many other
        young minds and lives just like his still out there, forming impressions about
        what it means to live and to die for a cause or even for the absence of one.
        For their sake, we must do our best to move beyond the present clich\u00E9s

        years.</p><p> In addition, as India focuses on smart cities, several states
        have begun considering mandatory energy conservation and green building codes
        in addition to offering sops for green construction. For example, cities like
        Noida and Pune offer both property tax benefits and additional building construction
        space (by giving 5 percent extra Floor Space Index) for green construction.
